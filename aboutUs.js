        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>ZoomRide</strong>, your trusted car rental service! The idea for ZoomRide came to life during a road trip among friends. Our founder, Alex Carter, saw how difficult it was to find reliable and affordable car rental options. Determined to change that, Alex launched ZoomRide with a vision to make renting a car as easy as ordering a coffee.
